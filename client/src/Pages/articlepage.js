            Bang shot, shot through my heart


Ignore it, I’m not falling apart

I can walk, talk and breathe

Now everything feels a bit off

Black and white, I feel slow and shallow 

Indifferent to the things that I love

People look at me like a man behind bars 

Like I’m there, but I’m also not

My presence is lacking, I’m not alive like I used to be 

I look down, there blood leaking, but nobody else sees it 

I’m lost in this crowd of people caught up in their own lives 

Holding onto this wound, expecting someone to ask if I’m alright 

But I’m starting to think nobody really cares 

That this is all some performative act, I’m seeking attention, I want someone to baby me 

And so I hold onto the wound, as it drains me of my blood 

Because I feel like it is the only commendable thing about me
